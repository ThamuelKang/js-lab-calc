**Summative Lab Part 1: JavaScript Calculator**

This Javascript file performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
Each time an arithmetic function is called, it creates an object with the operations, operand, and output and pushes it into an array. 
The file then prints the array to the console exposing the history of each operations.
